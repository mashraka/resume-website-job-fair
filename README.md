# resume-website-job-fair
Simple Resume built using markup languages (HTML, CSS), to facilitate sharing resume, updating resume, printing resume and storing professional information (up-to-date information regarding academic progression and professional development). 

## Why
Because I am broke. Printing paper through the libraries costs money that frankly, could be better spent buying myself a shawarma, not to mention the rising tomfoolery that is HP Printing Subscription policies. Ink Cartridges, on the other hand, only go on sale during Christmas break, and in these dreary economic times, most sales are absolute nonsense anyway. Therefore, as a mediocre, broke, college student with limited prospects in this overpopulated city of unemployed millions, creating an online method (like a website) is the most cost-effective, efficient, and user-friendly way of sharing my deep personal information with strangers, most of whom I will never meet. And all this only costs me my sanity and privacy! Woo-hoo! What a steal!
